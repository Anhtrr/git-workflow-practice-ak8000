# [Until further notice, think twice before using Google to download software] (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/until-further-notice-think-twice-before-using-google-to-download-software/)

I find this article interesting and quite important because this month i have seen multiple different issues with ads being used maliciously. Some cases were featured in in-game ads, the ones that
pop up automatically, and the malicious use there was that ads were messed with to show 3-5 ads in a row instead of just 1. In case of this article, it talks about ad links that are always first
featured in google search. Although not always, but oftentimes when lookiing up information these ads are not the go to sources and redirect to weird websited. So far, the only thing that i can do 
to prevent this is to ignore the first couple recommnedations, which are ads, and scroll down to find genuine websites, which can sometimes not always be clear, and even challenging when using 
gogle search on an iPhone. Since Google is used every day at such a grand scale, it has to ensure that users are top under risk of their information being stolen or installing malicious software 
when they are using it.
